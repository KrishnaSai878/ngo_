    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      NGO Connect is a national platform that brings together organizations, volunteers, and donors.
      We help NGOs showcase opportunities, volunteers find and book 2-hour slots, and donors support
      causes they care about. The platform offers skills-based matching, messaging, resources, projects,
      leaderboards, analytics, and more.
